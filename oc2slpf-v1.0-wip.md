#### Abstract:
Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable the command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation.  Stateless packet filtering is a cyber defense mechanism that denies or allows traffic based on static properties of the traffic (such as address, port, protocol etc). This profile defines the actions, targets, specifiers and options that are consistent with version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification in the context of stateless packet filtering.

# 1 Introduction
OpenC2 is a suite of specifications that enables command and control of cyber defense systems and components.  OpenC2 typically uses a request-response paradigm where a command is encoded by an OpenC2 producer (managing application) and transferred to an OpenC2 consumer (managed device or virtualized function) using a secure transport protocol, and the consumer can respond with status and any requested information.  The contents of both the command and the response are fully described in schemas, allowing both parties to recognize the syntax constraints imposed on the exchange.

OpenC2 allows the application producing the commands to discover the set of capabilities supported by the managed devices.  These capabilities permit the managing application to adjust its behavior to take advantage of the features exposed by the managed device.  The capability definitions can be easily extended in a noncentralized manner, allowing standard and non-standard capabilities to be defined with semantic and syntactic rigor.

## 1.1 IPR Policy
This specification is provided under the [Non-Assertion](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr#Non-Assertion-Mode) Mode of the OASIS IPR Policy, the mode chosen when the Technical Committee was established.

## 1.2 Terminology
* **Action**: The task or activity to be performed.
* **Actuator**: The entity that performs the action.
* **Command**: A message defined by an action-target pair that is sent from a producer and received by a consumer.
* **Consumer**: A managed device / application that receives Commands.  Note that a single device / application can have both consumer and producer capabilities.
* **Producer**: A manager application that sends Commands.
* **Response**: A message from a consumer to a producer acknowledging a command or returning the requested resources or status to a previously received request.
* **Target**: The object of the action, i.e., the action is performed on the target.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [[BCP 14, RFC2119](#rfc2119)] [[RFC8174](#rfc8174)] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## 1.**6** Overview
OpenC2 is a suite of specifications to command actuators that execute cyber defense functions.  These specifications include the OpenC2 Language Specification, Actuator Profiles, and Transfer Specifications.  The OpenC2 Language Specification and Actuator Profile(s) specifications focus on the standard at the producer and consumer of the command and response while the transfer specifications focus on the protocols for their exchange.

* The OpenC2 Language Specification provides the semantics for the essential elements of the language, the structure for commands and responses, and the schema that defines the proper syntax for the language elements that represents the command or response.
* OpenC2 Actuator Profiles specify the subset of the OpenC2 language relevant in the context of specific actuator functions. Cyber defense components, devices, systems and/or instances may (in fact are likely) to implement multiple actuator profiles.  Actuator profiles extend the language by defining specifiers that identify the actuator to the required level of precision and may define command arguments that are relevant and/or unique to those actuator functions.
* OpenC2 Transfer Specifications utilize existing protocols and standards to implement OpenC2 in specific environments. These standards are used for communications and security functions beyond the scope of the language, such as message transfer encoding, authentication, and end-to-end transport of OpenC2 messages.

The OpenC2 Language Specification defines a language used to compose messages for command and control of cyber defense systems and components.  A message consists of a header and a payload (_defined_ as a message body in the OpenC2 Language Specification Version 1.0 and _specified_ in one or more actuator profiles). 

In general, there are two types of participants involved in the exchange of OpenC2 messages, as depicted in Figure 1-1:

1. **OpenC2 Producers**: An OpenC2 Producer is an entity that creates commands to provide instruction to one or more systems to act in accordance with the content of the command. An OpenC2 Producer may receive and process responses in conjunction with a command.
2. **OpenC2 Consumers**: An OpenC2 Consumer is an entity that receives and may act upon an OpenC2 command.  An OpenC2 Consumer may create responses that provide any information captured or necessary to send back to the OpenC2 Producer. 

The language defines two payload structures:

1. **Command**: An instruction from one system known as the OpenC2 "Producer", to one or more systems, the OpenC2 "Consumer(s)", to act on the content of the command.
2. **Response**: Any information captured or necessary to send back to the OpenC2 Producer  that issued the Command, i.e., the OpenC2 Consumerâs response to the OpenC2 Producer.

**Figure 1-1. OpenC2 Message Exchange**

OpenC2 implementations integrate the related OpenC2 specifications described above with related industry specifications, protocols, and standards. Figure 1 depicts the relationships among OpenC2 specifications, and their relationships to other industry standards and environment-specific implementations of OpenC2. Note that the layering of implementation aspects in the diagram is notional, and not intended to preclude, e.g., the use of an application-layer message signature function to provide message source authentication and integrity. 

![no alt title](./images/image_2.png)

**Figure 1-2. OpenC2 Documentation and Layering Model**

OpenC2 is conceptually partitioned into four layers as shown in Table 1-1.

**Table 1-1. OpenC2 Protocol Layers**

| Layer | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| Function-Specific Content | Actuator Profiles<br>(standard and extensions) |
| Common Content | Language Specification<br>(this document) |
| Message | Transfer Specifications<br>(OpenC2-over-HTTPS, OpenC2-over-CoAP, â¦) |
| Secure Transport | HTTPS, CoAP, MQTT, OpenDXL, ... |

* The **Secure Transport** layer provides a communication path between the producer and the consumer.  OpenC2 can be layered over any standard transport protocol.
* The **Message** layer provides a transport- and content-independent mechanism for conveying requests, responses, and notifications.  A transfer specification maps transport-specific protocol elements to a transport-independent set of message elements consisting of content and associated metadata.  
* The **Common Content** layer defines the structure of OpenC2 commands and responses and a set of common language elements used to construct them.
* The **Function-specific Content** layer defines the language elements used to support a particular cyber defense function.  An actuator profile defines the implementation conformance requirements for that function.  OpenC2 Producers and Consumers will support one or more profiles.

The components of an OpenC2 Command are an action (what is to be done), a target (what is being acted upon), an optional actuator (what is performing the command), and command arguments, which influence how the command is to be performed. An action coupled with a target is sufficient to describe a complete OpenC2 Command. Though optional, the inclusion of an actuator and/or command arguments provides additional precision to a command, when needed.

The components of an OpenC2 Response are a numerical status code, an optional status text string, and optional results. The format of the results, if included, depend on the type or response being transferred. 

## 1.7 Goal
The goal of the OpenC2 Language Specification is to provide a language for interoperating between functional elements of cyber defense systems. This language used in conjunction with OpenC2 Actuator Profiles and OpenC2 Transfer Specifications allows for vendor-agnostic cybertime response to attacks.

The Integrated Adaptive Cyber Defense (IACD) framework defines a collection of activities, based on the traditional OODA (ObserveâOrientâDecideâAct) Loop [IACD]:

* Sensing:  gathering of data regarding system activities
* Sense Making:  evaluating data using analytics to understand what's happening
* Decision Making:  determining a course-of-action to respond to system events
* Acting:  Executing the course-of-action 

The goal of OpenC2 is to enable coordinated defense in cyber-relevant time between decoupled blocks that perform cyber defense functions.  OpenC2 focuses on the Acting portion of the IACD framework; the assumption that underlies the design of OpenC2 is that the sensing/ analytics have been provisioned and the decision to act has been made. This goal and these assumptions guides the design of OpenC2:

* **Technology Agnostic:**  The OpenC2 language defines a set of abstract atomic cyber defense actions in a platform and product agnostic manner
* **Concise:**  An OpenC2 command is intended to convey only the essential information required to describe the action required and can be represented in a very compact form for communications-constrained environments
* **Abstract:**  OpenC2 commands and responses are defined abstractly and can be encoded and transferred via multiple schemes as dictated by the needs of different implementation environments
* **Extensible:**  While OpenC2 defines a core set of actions and targets for cyber defense, the language is expected to evolve with cyber defense technologies, and permits extensions to accommodate new cyber defense technologies.

## 1.8 Purpose and Scope
A âStateless Packet Filterâ (SLPF) is a policy enforcement mechanism that restricts or permits traffic based on static values such as source address, destination address, and/or port numbers.  A Stateless-Packet-Filter does not consider traffic patterns, connection state, data flows, applications, or payload information.  The scope of this profile is limited to Stateless-Packet-Filtering herein referred to as SLPF. 

This actuator profile specifies the set of actions, targets, specifiers, and command arguments that integrates SLPF functionality with the Open Command and Control (OpenC2) command set. Through this command set, cyber security orchestrators may gain visibility into and provide control over the SLPF functionality in a manner that is independent of the instance of the SLPF function. 

All components, devices and systems that provide SLPF functionality will implement the OpenC2 ACTIONS, TARGETS, SPECIFIERS and ARGS identified as required in this document. Actions that are applicable, but not necessarily required, for SLPF will be identified as optional.

The purpose of this document is to:

* Identify the required and optional OpenC2 ACTIONS for actuators with SLPF functionality.
* Identify the required and optional TARGET types and associated specifiers for each action in the SLPF class of actuators.
* Identify ACTUATOR-SPECIFIERS,  ACTUATOR-ARGS and COMMAND-ARGS for each action-target pair that are applicable and/or unique to the SLPF class of actuators
* Annotate each Action/ Target pair with a justification and example, and provide sample OpenC2 commands to a SLPF with corresponding responses 
* Provide an abstract schema that captures the specifiers and options for a SLPF 

This SLPF profile:

* Does not define or implement ACTIONS beyond those defined in Version 1.0 of the Language Specification.
* Is consistent with version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification

Cyber defense systems that are utilizing OpenC2 may require the following components to implement the SLPF profile: 

* OpenC2 Producers: Devices that send commands, receive responses, and manage the execution of commands involving one or more SLPF or other actuators with SLPF capability. The OpenC2 producer needs _a priori_ knowledge of which commands the actuator can process and execute, therefore must understand the profiles for any device that it intends to command.
* OpenC2 Consumers: Devices or instances that provide stateless packet filtering functions.  Typically these are actuators that execute the cyber defense function, but could be orchestrators (i.e., a device or instance that forwards commands to the actuator).  

Though cyber defense components, devices, systems and/or instances may  may implement multiple actuator profiles, a particular OpenC2 message may reference at most a single actuator profile. The scope of this document is limited to SLPF. 

This specification is organized into three major sections.  

Section One (this section) provides a nonnormative overview of the suite of specifications that realize OpenC2.  This section provides references as well as defines the scope and purpose of this specification. 

Section Two (normative) binds this particular profile to the OpenC2 Language Specification.  Section Two enumerates the components of the language specification that are meaningful in the context of  SLPF and defines components that are applicable to this distinct profile.  Section Two also defines the commands (i.e., the action target pairs) that are permitted in the context of SLPF. 

Section Three (normative) presents definitive criteria for conformance so that cyber security stakeholders can be assured that their products, instances and/or integrations are compatible with OpenC2.  

This specification provides three non-normative Annexes.  OpenC2 is intended for machine to machine interactions, therefore a schema for SLPF and the applicable portions of the OpenC2 Language schema are provided to facilitate development.  There is also an Annex that provides multiple examples of SLPF commands (JSON serialization).

# 2 OpenC2 Language Binding
This section defines the set of ACTIONS, TARGETS, SPECIFIERS, and ARGS that are meaningful in the context of an SLPF. This section also describes the format of the response frame's status and results field. This section organized into three major subsections; Command Components, Response Components and Commands. 

## 2.1 OpenC2 Command Components 
The components of an OpenC2 command include ACTIONS, TARGETS, ACTUATORS and associated ARGS and SPECIFIERS.  Appropriate aggregation of the components will define a command-body that is meaningful in the context of an SLPF.  

This specification identifies the applicable components of an OpenC2 command.  The components of an OpenC2 command include: 

* ACTION:  A subset of the ACTIONs defined in the OpenC2 Language specification that are meaningful in the context of a SLPF. 
    * This profile does not define ACTIONs that are external to Version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification.
    * This profile MAY augment the definition of the actions in the context of a SLPF.
    * This profile SHALL NOT define ACTIONs in a manner that is inconsistent with version 1.0 of the OpenC2 language specification.
* TARGET:   A subset of the TARGETs and target-specifiers defined in the Language specification that are meaningful in the context of SLPF and one TARGET (and its associated specifier) that is defined in this specification. 
* ARGS:  A subset of the COMMAND-ARGS defined in the Language Specification and a set of ACTUATOR-ARGS defined in this specification.  
* ACTUATOR:  A set of specifiers defined in this specification that are meaningful in the context of SLPF. 

### 2.1.1 Actions
Table 2.1.1-1 presents the OpenC2 actions defined in version 1.0 of the Language Specification which are meaningful in the context of an SLPF.  The particular action/target pairs that are required or optional are presented in section 2.3.

#### 2.1.2.2 SLPF Targets
The slpf:Target type is defined in this specification and is referenced under the slpf namespace. Implementations that choose to include this type MUST import it in accordance with the procedures defined in section 2.2.6 of Version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification:

1. The unique name of the SLPF schema is `oasis-open.org/openc2/v1.0/ap-slpf`
2. The namespace identifier (nsid) referring to the SLPF schema is:  `slpf`
3. The list of types imported from the SLPF schema is: `Target`, `Actuator`, `Args`, and `Results`.
4. The definitions of and conformance requirements for these types are contained in this document.

**_Type: Target (Choice)_**

| ID | Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **rule_number** | Rule-ID | Immutable identifier assigned when a rule is created, Identifies a rule to be deleted. |

### 2.1.3 Command Arguments
Arguments provide additional precision to a command by including information such as how, when, or where a command is to be executed.  Table 2.1.3-1 summarizes the command arguments defined in Version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification as they relate to SLPF functionality.  Table 2.1.3-2 summarizes the command arguments that are defined in this specification.

#### 2.1.3.1 Common Args
Table 2.1.3.1-1 lists the command arguments defined in the OpenC2 Language specification that are applicable to SLPF.

**Table 2.1.3-1. Command Arguments applicable to SLPF**

**_Type: Args (Map)_**

| ID | Name | Type | # | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **start_time** | Date-Time | 0..1 | The specific date/time to initiate the action  |
| 2 | **stop_time** | Date-Time | 0..1 | The specific date/time to terminate the action |
| 3 | **duration** | Duration | 0..1 | The length of time for an action to be in effect |
| 4 | **response_requested** | Response-Type | 0..1 | The type of response required for the action: `none`, `ack`, `status`, `complete`.  |
| 1024 | **slpf** | slpf:Args | 0..1 | Command arguments defined in the Stateless Packet Filter profile |

The semantics/requirements as they relate to common arguments:  

* start-time/end-time/duration
    * If none are specified then the start time is now, the end time is never, and the duration is infinity
    * Only two of the three are allowed on any given command and the third is derived from the equation end-time = start-time + duration
    * If only start time is specified then end-time is never and duration is infinity
    * If only end time is specified then start-time is now and duration is derived
    * If only duration is specified then start-time is now and end-time is derived
* response_requested 
    * If absent or not explicitly set in an OpenC2 Command, then a Consumer MUST respond the same as response_type `complete`. 

#### 2.1.3.2 SLPF Args
The command arguments defined in this document are referenced under the slpf namespace.

**Table 2.1.3-2. Command Arguments Unique to SLPF**

**_Type: Args (Map)_**

| ID | Name | Type | # | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **drop_process** | Drop-Process | 0..1 | Specifies how to handle denied packets |
| 2 | **running** | Boolean | 0..1 | Normal operations assumes any change to a device are to be implemented as persistent changes. Setting the running modifier to TRUE results in a change that is not persistent in the event of a reboot or restart.  |
| 3 | **direction** | Direction | 0..1 | Specifies whether to apply rules to incoming or outgoing traffic.  If omitted, rules are applied to both.   |
| 4 | **insert_rule** | Rule-ID | 0..1 | Specifies the identifier of the rule within a list, typically used in a top-down rule list. |

    * If absent, then the command MUST apply to both. 
* drop_process:  If absent or not explicitly set, then the actuator MUST NOT send any notification to the source of the packet
* running:  If absent or not explicitly set, then the value is FALSE and any changes are persistent.  

### 2.1.4 Actuator Specifiers
An ACTUATOR is the entity that provides the functionality and performs the action. The ACTUATOR executes the ACTION on the TARGET. In the context of this profile, the actuator is the SLPF and the presence of one or more specifiers further refine which actuator(s) shall execute the action.

Table 2.1.4-1 lists the specifiers that are applicable to the SPLF actuator. Annex C  provides sample commands with the use of specifiers.

The actuator specifiers defined in this document are referenced under the slpf namespace.

## 2.3 OpenC2 Commands
An OpenC2 command consists of an ACTION/TARGET pair and associated SPECIFIERS and ARGUMENTs.  This section enumerates the allowed commands, identify which are required or optional to implement, and present the associated responses.  

Table 2.3-1 defines the commands allowed by the SLPF profile and indicates if implementation of the command is required or optional for Openc2 Producers and/or Openc2 Consumers.  An ACTION (the top row in Table 2.3-1) paired with a TARGET (the first column in Table 2.3-1) defines an allowable command. The subsequent subsections provide the property tables applicable to each OpenC2 command. 

**Table 2.3-1. Command Matrix**

|   | Allow | Deny | Query | Delete | Update |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ip_connection** | required | required |   |   |   |
| **ip_addr** | required | required |   |   |   |
| **features** |   |   | required |   |   |
| **slpf:rule_number** |   |   |   | optional |   |
| **file** |   |   |   |   | optional |

Table 2.3-2 defines the command arguments that are allowed for a particular command by the SLPF profile.  A command (the top row in Table 2.3-2) paired with an argument (the first column in Table 2.3-2) defines an allowable combination. The subsection identified at the intersection of the command/ argument provides details applicable to each command as influenced by the argument. 

**Table 2.3-2. Command Arguments Matrix**

The âallow ip_connectionâ command is required for openc2 producers implementing the SLPF.  

If the âallow ip_addrâ target is not implemented, then SLPF consumers MUST implement the âallow ip-connectionâ command. Otherwise it is OPTIONAL.  

The command permits traffic that is consistent with the specified ip_connection.  A valid âallow ip_connectionâ command has at least one property of the ip_connection populated and may have any combination of the five properties populated.  An unpopulated property within the the ip_connection target MUST be treated as an âanyâ.

Products that receive âdeny targetâ commands and support the âinsert_ruleâ command argument:

* MUST assign the rule number provided if the "insert_rule" : <integer> argument is populated. 
* If the rule number is currently in use, then 
    * MUST NOT respond with a OK/200. 
    * SHOULD respond with the 501 status code 
    * SHOULD respond with âRule number currently in useâ in the status text. 
    * MAY respond with the 500 status code.

### 2.3.3 âQueryâ
The valid target type, associated specifiers, and options are summarized in section 2.3.3.1.  Sample commands are presented in Annex C.

The âdelete slpf:rule_numberâ command is used to remove a firewall rule rather than issue an allow or deny to counteract the effect of an existing rule. Implementation of the âdelete slpf:rule_numberâ command is OPTIONAL.  Products that choose to implement the âdelete slpf:rule_numberâ  command MUST implement the slpf:rule_number target type described in section 2.1.2.1. 

Products that send the âdelete slpf:rule_numberâ command: 

* MAY populate the command arguments field with âresponse_requested" : "completeâ.
* MUST NOT include other command arguments.  
* MUST include exactly one rule_number.  

Products that receive the âdelete slpf:rule_numberâ command:

* but cannot parse or process the âdelete slpf:rule_numberâ command:
    * MUST NOT respond with a OK/200. 
    * SHOULD respond with status code 400.  
    * MAY respond with the 500 status code
* but do not support the slpf:rule_number target type 
    * MUST NOT respond with a OK/200. 
    * SHOULD respond with the 501 status code
    * SHOULD respond with âtarget not supportedâ in the status text.

    * MUST respond with response code 500  
    * SHOULD respond with âfirewall rule not removed or updatedâ in the status text.  

Refer to Annex C for sample commands.  

### 2.3.5 Update
The âfileâ target as defined in Version 1.0 of the Language Specification is the only valid target type for the update action. The associated specifiers, and options are summarized in section 2.3.5.1.  Sample commands are presented in Annex C.  

#### 2.3.5.1 Update file 
The âupdate fileâ command is used to replace or update files such as configuration files, rule sets,  etc.  Implementation of the update file command is OPTIONAL.  OpenC2 consumers that choose to implement the âupdate fileâ command MUST must include all steps that are required for the update file procedure such as retrieving the file(s), install the file(s), restart/ reboot the device etc.  The end state shall be that the firewall operates with the new file at the conclusion of the âupdate fileâ command.  The atomic steps that take place are implementation specific.  

Table 2.3-2 presents the valid options for the âupdate fileâ command.   Products that choose to implement the âupdate fileâ command MUST NOT include options other than the options identified in table 2.3-2

  

Products that send the âupdate fileâ command:

# Annex B  Tailored OpenC2 Schema 
This annex is a copy of the schema from the OpenC2 Language Specification tailored to include only elements needed to support the SLPF functions defined in this document.  This subset defines the elements of the Language Specification that are meaningful in the context of SLPF, however an implementation may have capabilities beyond the scope of an SLPF therefore may support additional elements of the OpenC2 language beyond those included here. 

This annex is non-normative.

# Annex C Sample commands (Informative)
This section will summarize and provide examples of OpenC2 commands as they pertain to SLPF firewalls. The sample commands will be encoded in verbose JSON, however other encodings are possible provided the command is validated against the schema presented in Annex A.  Examples of corresponding responses will be provided where appropriate.

The samples provided in this section are for illustrative purposes only and are not to be interpreted as operational examples for actual systems.

The following examples include Binary fields which are serialized in Base64url format.  The examples show JSON-serialized commands; the conversion of Base64url serialized values to Binary data and String display text is:

| Base64url | Binary | Display String |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `AQIDBA` | `01020304` | `1.2.3.4` |
| `xgIDBA` | `c6020304` | `198.2.3.4` |
| `xjNkEQ` | `c6336411` | `198.51.100.17` |

The examples include Integer Date-Time fields; the conversion of Integer values to String display text is:

| Integer | Display String |
| :--- | :--- |
| `1534775460000` | `Monday, August 20, 2018 2:31:00 PM GMT, 2018-08-20T10:31:00-04:00` |

## C.1 Deny and Allow
Deny and allow are mandatory to implement and can be treated as mathematical complements of each other. Unless otherwise stated, the example targets, specifiers, modifiers and corresponding responses are applicable to both actions.

### C.1.1 Deny a particular connection
Block a particular connection within the domain and do not send a host unreachable

**Command:**

```
{
  "action": "deny",
  "target": {
    "ip_connection": {
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "src_addr": "AQIDBA",
      "src_port": 10996,
      "dst_addr": "xgIDBA",
      "dst_port": 80
    }
  },
  "args": {
    "start_time": 1534775460000,
    "duration": 500,
    "response_requested": "ack",
    "slpf": {
      "drop_process": "none"
    }
  },
  "actuator": {
    "slpf": {
      "asset_id": "30"
    }
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```
{  
    "status": 200
}
```

### C.1.2  Block all outbound ftp transfers
Block all outbound ftp data transfers, send false acknowledgement and request ack. Note that the five-tuple is incomplete. Note that the response_type field was not populated therefore will be âcompleteâ. Also note that the actuator called out was SLPF with no additional specifiers, therefore all endpoints that can execute the command should.

**Command:**

```
{
  "action": "deny",
  "target": {
    "ip_connection": {
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "src_port": 21
    }
  },
  "args": {
    "slpf": {
      "drop_process": "false_ack"
      "direction": "egress"
    }
  },
  "actuator": {
    "slpf": {}
  }
}
```

**Responses:**

Case One: the actuator successfully issued the deny.

```
{"status": 200}
```

Case Two: the command failed due to a syntax error in the command.  Optional status text can provide error details for debugging or logging.

```
{  
  "status": 400,
  "status_text": "Validation Error: Target: ip_conection"
}
```

Case Three: the command failed because an argument was not supported.

```
{  
  "status": 501
}
```

### C.1.3  Block all inbound traffic from a particular source. 
Block all inbound traffic from 1.2.3.4 and do not respond. In this case the ip_addr target and the direction argument was used. In this case only the perimeter filters should update the rule.

**Command:**

```
{
  "action": "deny",
  "target": {
    "ip_addr": "AQIDBA"
  },
  "args": {
    "response_requested": "none",
    "slpf": {
      "direction": "ingress"
    }
  },
  "actuator": {
    "slpf": {
      "named_group": "perimeter"
    }
  }
}
```

### C.1.4 Permit ftp transfers to a particular destination. 
Permit ftp data transfers to ip address 198.51.100.17 from any source.  (Note that an actual application would also need to allow ftp-data (port 20) in order for transfers to be permitted.)

**Command:**

```
{
  "action": "allow",
  "target": {
    "ip_connection": {
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "dst_addr": "xjNkEQ",
      "src_port": 21
    }
  },
  "actuator": {
    "slpf": {}
  }
}
```

In this case the actuator returned a rule number associated with the allow. 

**Response:**

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "slpf": {
    "rule_number": 1234
  }
}
```

## C.2 Delete Rule
Used to remove a firewall rule rather than issue an allow or deny to counteract the effect of an existing rule. Implementation of the âdelete slpf:rule_numberâ command is OPTIONAL.

In this case the rule number assigned in a previous allow will be removed (refer to the final example in section C.1)

**Command:**

```
{
  "action": "delete",
  "target": {
    "slpf": {
      "rule_number": 1234
    }
  },
  "args": {
    "response_requested": "complete"
  },
  "actuator": {
    "slpf": {}
  }
}
```

## C.3 Update file
Implementation of the Update action is optional.  Update is intended for the device to process new configuration files. The update action is a compound action in that all of the steps required for a successful update (such as download the new file, install the file, reboot etc.) are implied. File is the only valid target type for Update.

Instructs the firewalls to acquire a new configuration file. Note that all network based firewalls will install the new update because no particular firewall was identified. Host based firewalls will not act on this because network firewalls were identified as the actuator. 

**Command:**

```
{
  "action": "update",
  "target": {
    "file": {
      "path": "\\\\someshared-drive\\somedirectory\\configurations",
      "name": "firewallconfiguration.txt"
    }
  },
  "actuator": {
    "slpf": {
      "named_group": "network"
    }
  }
}
```

**Responses:**

Successful update of the configuration 

```
{"status": 200}
```

This actuator does not support the update file command 

```
{
  "status": 501,
  "status_text": "Update-File Not Implemented"
}
```

This actuator could not access the file 

```
{
  "status": 500,
  "status_text": "Server error, Cannot access file"
}
```

## C.4 Query openc2
Implementation of query openc2 is required.  The query openc2 command is intended to enable the openc2 producer to determine the capabilities of the actuator.  The query openc2 command can also be used to check the status of the actuator.

### C.4.1 No query items set 
This command uses query openc2 with no query items to verify that the actuator is functioning. 

**Command:**

```
{
  "action": "query",
  "target": {
    "openc2": []
  }
}
```

**Response:**

The actuator is alive.

```
{"status": 200}
```

### C.4.2 Version of Language specification supported
This command queries the actuator to determine which version(s) of the language specification are supported.  The language specifications use semantic versioning ("major.minor"); for each supported major version the actuator need only report the highest supported minor version.

**Command:**

```
{
  "action": "query",
  "target": {
    "openc2": ["versions"]
  }
}
```

**Response:**

The Actuator supports language specification versions 1.0 - 1.3.

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "versions": ["1.3"]
}
```

### C.4.3 Actuator profiles supported
This command queries the actuator to determine both the language versions and the actuator profiles supported.

**Command:**

```
{
  "action": "query",
  "target": {
    "openc2": ["versions", "profiles"]
  }
}
```

**Response:**

The actuator device is apparently a smart toaster for which an extension actuator profile has been written.  The device supports both the standard slpf functions and whatever commands are defined in the extension profile.

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "versions": ["1.3"],
  "profiles": [
    "oasis-open.org/openc2/v1.0/ap-slpf",
    "example.com/openc2/products/iot-toaster"
    ]
}
```

### C.4.4 Specific Commands Supported
This command queries the actuator to determine which action-target pairs are supported.  Not all targets are meaningful in the context of a specific action, and although a command such as "update ip_connection" may be syntactically valid, the combination does not specify an operation supported by the actuator.

**Command:**

For each supported action list the targets supported by this actuator.

```
{
  "action": "query",
  "target": {
    "openc2": ["pairs"]
  }
}
```

**Response:**

The actuator supports all action-target pairs shown in Table 2.3-1 - Command Matrix.

```
{
  "status": 200,
  "pairs": [
    ["allow", ["ip_addr", "ip_connection"]],
    ["deny", ["ip_addr", "ip_connection"]],
    ["query", ["openc2"]],
    ["delete", ["slpf:rule_number"]],
    ["update", ["file"]]
  ]
}
```

### C.4.5 Actuator Schema
This command queries the actuator for the syntax definition for all supported commands.

**Command:**

```
{
  "action": "query",
  "target": {
    "openc2": ["schema"]
  }
}
```

**Response:**

The result is a single schema defining the syntax of all commands supported by this actuator.  It is constructed from:

1. the tailored OpenC2 schema module (Annex B), merged with
2. each imported module (e.g., the SLPF schema module of Annex A, schemas from other profiles supported by this actuator), and,
3. further tailored for the specific actuator product by removing any unsupported optional elements.

**Schema File:**

The non-normative merged schema example (oc2ls-v1.0-slpf-merged.json) shown in this response is provided as a separate file, listed in the [Additional artifacts](#additional-artifacts) section on the front page of this specification.

# Annex E Revision History
| Revision | Date | Editor | Changes Made |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Committee Specification Draft 1 | 31 AUG 2018 | Brule, Joe | Initial draft |
| Committee Specification Draft 2 | 04 OCT 2018 | Brule, Joe | Added Document overview, complete rewrite of introduction, modified components section to be consistent with Language Specification and address ballot comments, added schema, added conformance section, added examples, added acknowledgements section.   |
| Committee Specification Draft 3 | 16 OCT 2018 | Brule, Joe | Aligned section 1 with other OpenC2 specifications; other changes to track dependencies on the language specification:  1) replace openc2 target with features target, 2) flatten response examples so that there is not a separate "results" layer. |
