2. Base Commands (ACTION and TARGET pairs):
    1. **MUST** implement the following action target pairs where the actions and targets are defined in version 1.0 of the Language specification.  
        1. ‘allow ip_connection’ or  ‘allow ip_addr’ in accordance with the normative text provided in section 2.3.1 of this specification
        2. ‘deny ip_connection’ or ‘deny ip_addr’ in accordance with the normative text provided in section 2.3.2 of this specification

3. Command Arguments:
    1. **MUST** implement the ‘response_requested’ command argument as a valid option for any command: 
    2. Processing response_requested command arguments
        1. All commands received with the response argument set to ‘none’ **MUST** process the command and **MUST NOT** send a response. This conformance clause supersedes all other normative text as it pertains to responses.
        2. All commands received without the response argument (or response argument not set) **MUST** process the command and respond in a manner that is consistent with "response_requested" : "complete".
